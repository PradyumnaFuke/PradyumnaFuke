### ℹ️ About me
🧭 I love **programming** and I want to create something of my own.

🧠 I'm interested in:
- **Science**
- **History**
- **Art**
- **Photography**
- **Philosophy**
- **Filmmaking**
- **Programming**
- **Animation**

Whatever I like basically falls into either  knowledge or creativity.

🤖 I love to create stuff and I would love to  combine all these things into a single original project some day.

🚀 Science, scientists & explorers inspire me.

🧭 Somehow I have the curiosity and excitement of ten people combined and it drives me to learn more about the things I love and to explore this world.

👾 Right now I am learning programming and don't know many things yet but I will do my best.
