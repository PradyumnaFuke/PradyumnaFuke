## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PradyumnaFuke
- ðŸ§­ I love programming and I want to create something of my own.
- ðŸ§  I'm also interested in Science, History, Art, Photography, Philosophy, Filmmaking & Animation and would love to combine all these things into a single project some day.
- Whatever I like basically falls into either  knowledge or creativity.
- ðŸ‘¾ Right now I am learning programming and don't know many things yet but I will do my best.
- ðŸš€ Science, scientists & explorers inspire me.
- ðŸ¤– I love to create stuff.
- ðŸ§­ Somehow I have the curiosity and excitement of ten people combined and it drives me to learn more about the things I love and to explore this world.
