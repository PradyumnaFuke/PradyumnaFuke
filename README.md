- 👋 Hi, I’m @PradyumnaFuke
- 🧭 I love programming and I want to create something of my own.
- 🧠 I'm also interested in Science, History, Art, Philosophy & Animation and would love to combine all these things into a single project some day.
- Right now I am learning programming and don't know many things but I will do my best.
- Science inspires me.
- I love to create stuff.
- Somehow I have the curiosity and excitement of ten people combined and it drives me to learn more about the things I love and to explore this world.
